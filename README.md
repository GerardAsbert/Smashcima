A fork of [Smashcima](https://github.com/OMR-Research/Smashcima), this project enables **synthetic generation of handwritten-style music scores** using **custom symbol images from a local folder** rather than from MUSCIMA++ writers.

---

## üîç Key Features

- ‚úÖ Render synthetic handwritten musical scores using your own collection of musical symbols.
- ‚úÖ Choose between the **Base** and **Tweaked** generation models.
- ‚úÖ Automatically renders and saves each score page as a `.png` image.
- ‚úÖ Processes batches of MusicXML files from a folder.

## üì¶ Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies inside a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GerardAsbert/Smashcima.git
cd Smashcima

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
---

## üöÄ Usage

You can run the `generate_partitures.py` script to synthesize handwritten scores using either the base or tweaked rendering model.

```bash
python generate_partitures.py base /path/to/musicxml_folder /path/to/output_folder
```

### Arguments:

- `model_type`: `base` or `tweaked` ‚Äì which model to use for rendering.
- `input_path`: Directory containing `.musicxml` files.
- `output_path`: Directory where the output `.png` images will be saved.

Each `.musicxml` file in the input folder will be rendered and saved as a `.png` file in the output folder.

## üß† How This Differs From Original Smashcima

- ‚úÇÔ∏è **MUSCIMA++ dependency removed:** You can now render using your own glyph images.
- üìÇ **Batch processing of MusicXML files:** Feed in a folder of MusicXML files.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Minimal CLI interface:** Easily select rendering model and input/output folders.
